* fn main()
    Responds to epoll events, calling parseSwitch() to parse packets.
    sends packets to server for:
        * keepalive
        * respawn when death notify
        * confirm teleport request
        * send complete login
        * chats with the dudes

* fn updateBots
    this function runs a 20tps game loop
    Currently all it does is process the movment list generated by path finding, sending position updates
    sends packets to server. does this with a mutex stored in Bot struct




## Design Ideas
updateBots process the action list

if it encounters an error with the list it somehow notifys the bot script?

Lets assume bot script is just another thread.


BOTSCRIPT_01{
    while true{
        pathfindresult = pathfind_nearestTree();
        if(pathfindresult is success)
            set_bot_action_list(pathfindresult.list)
            switch(waitUntilActionListClear()){
                action_list_error =>{//handle error, maybe just restart the loop?},
                action_success => {
                    gens = generateFellTreeInstructions
                    if(gens is success )

                }
            }
        else{
            //handle not being able to pathfind. maybe just sleep for a while
        }
    }

}

Shared resources between UpdateBots and a script:
bot.action_list

thread updateBot:
if(has shared_lock)

    if(action_list is empty)
        shared.action_state = .empty
        unlock_shared
    else if(action_list is error)
        shared.action_state = .error
        unlock_shared
    else process actions

thread botScript:
obtain shared lock
switch(shared.action_state)
    empty=> fill with actions
    error=> handle error condition
    eventually
        unlock shared
