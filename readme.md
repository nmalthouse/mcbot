# Bot

What if we just named properties?

## Hosting multiple bots:
bot_list
connection_list

Deal with having multiple instances of the same packet
Can be time based, if the packet is to a different id and is within 1/10 of a second from the last, discard


## pathfinding:
Block specific behavior
Stairs
Fences
Doors
ladders
water
Transparent: Grass, rail, etc
