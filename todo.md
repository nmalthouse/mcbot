# Global TODO
* verbose logging of the different systems to a file
* wrapper around epoll() to allow for a other platforms or a single tcpConnectToHost
* Cleanup the vector classes, move to using zalgebra? 
* Tune the pathfinder for large vertical movements
* Store a per-bot entity list rather than a single global list.
* Notify Lua scripts when errors occur
