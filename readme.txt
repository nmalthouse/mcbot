A Minecraft Bot written in zig

Current features:
- pathfinding
- basic inventory interaction
- multiple bots
- lua scripting
- offline mode only
- 1.19.3
- linux only because of epoll usage, can easily be changed

Cool problems to solve:
A bot that fells and replants trees in an area
A bot that manages a set of chests, sorting items, retrieving requested items.
A bot that goes strip mining
A bot that goes hunting
A bot that manages the breeding and slaughtering of animals
A bot that farms a section of land


Todo:
Codegen for protocol.json. At the very least have zig enums generated for packet id's.
